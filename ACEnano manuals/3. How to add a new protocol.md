## How to add a new protocol
The protocols database facilitates the access and sharing of methodologies applied in nanosafety. The methods are easy to browse and are linked to experimental datasets. This tool aims also to facilitate sharing of state of the art methods with the NanoEHS community and beyond.

After logging on at https://acenano.douglasconnect.com/ you can add a new protocol by following these steps:

1.Click the *Protocols* button from the top menu to open the *ACEnano Protocols* page.

</p>

2. On *ACEnano Protocols* page, find the red button *Add a new protocol* between the explanatory paragraph and the list of protocols.

</p>

3.By clicking the button *Add a new protocol*, a new page is displayed, containing the description of the different protocol types which can be added to the database:
  - **Sample Preparation Protocol**
  - **Measurement Protocol**
  - **Data Treatment Protocol**

</p>

4. Regardless of the protocol type you choose to add, the first page of the protocol is approximately the same. It contains an explanation of the protocol parts and the questionnaire on *Part 1: General information*:

4.1.In the *Protocol name and description* area, the fields *Protocol original name*, *Version of this protocol*, *Variant of this protocol*, *Brief description*, *Long description*, *References* are to be completed with free text and the dropdown lists *Development phase*, *Confidentiality*, *License* to be clicked for choosing an exclusive item.

</p>

4.2.In the *Contacts* area, the *Name and email of contact person for the protocols* fields are to be completed also with free text.

4.3.*Technique and Endpoints* area is different for each of the protocol types:

4.3.1.For **Sample Preparation Protocol**, in the list box with techniques, multiple techniques can be selected at a time, by holding Ctrl.

4.3.2.For the **Measurement Protocol**, in the dropdown lists *Technique*, and *Phase* only one technique and phase can be selected, but in the list box *Endpoints*, multiple selections on the endpoints can be done at a time by holding Ctrl.

</p>

4.3.3.For the **Data Treatment Protocol**, this part doesn't exist.

5.By pressing the red bottom *Continue to next step* at the end of the first page, the protocol chestionare continues with pages specific for each protocol type:

5.1.For the **Sample Preparation Protocol**, in the second page embodying the *Part 2: Steps*, the steps of the protocol need to be added by choosing the number in the *Step* box, the action in the dropdown list of *Actions* and the phases in the *Start Phase* and *End Phase* dropdown lists. Steps can be deleted by selecting the checkbox *Delete this step* and extended by pressing the *+Add another step* button.

</p>

5.2.For the **Measurement Protocol**:

5.2.1. In the second page, embodying *Part 2: Equipment*, free text need to be written in all:
- *Equipment* area,  with:  *Name*, *Model*, *Instrument type*, *Limit of detection upper*, *Limit of detection lower*, *Limit of       detection unit*, *Instrument settings and parameters* fields;
- *Possible datasets*area, with: *Axe*, *Units*  fields
- *Measurement quality parameters* area, with: *Parameter*, *Common setting* and  *Units* fields.

In each of these areas, the fields can be deleted by checking the delete boxes or extended by clicking the addition button.

5.2.2.Click the red button *Continue to the next step* to arrive at the third page, embodying the *Part 3: Steps*.

5.2.3.The *Step* number box, *Name* and *Description* fields need to be completed with free text. Optionally, an image can be uploaded via *Chose file* in the *Image* box. Steps can be deleted by selecting the checkbox *Delete this step* and extended by pressing the *+Add another step* button.

5.3.For **Data Treatment Protocol**, the second page, embodying *Part 2: Steps*, the fields containing the *Step* number box, *Algorithm applied*, *Resulting data* and *Parameters* need to be completed with free text. Steps can be deleted by selecting the checkbox *Delete this step* and extended by pressing the *+Add another step* button.

6.Click  the red *Submit protocol* button at the bottom of the last page of the protocol questionnaire (second page for **Sample Preparation Protocol** and **Data Treatment Protocol** and third page for the **Measurement Protocol**) to arrive at the page containing the *Preview protocol* allowing to proofread the protocol before submission.

7.If everything itâ€™s alright, commit the protocol by pressing the *Submit protocol* button. If corrections/modifications are needed, press the *Make more changes* button and edit any part, area or field of the protocol by passing through pages from *Part 1: General information* and moving towards the *Preview protocol* page.
