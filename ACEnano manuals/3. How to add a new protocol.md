## How to add a new protocol
The protocols database facilitates the access and sharing of methodologies applied in nanosafety. The methods are easy to browse and are linked to experimental datasets. This tool aims also to facilitate sharing of state of the art methods with the NanoEHS community and beyond.

After logging on at https://acenano.douglasconnect.com/ you can add a new protocol by following these steps:

1.Click the *Protocols* button from the top menu to open the *ACEnano Protocols* page.

</p>

2.On *ACEnano Protocols* page, find the red button *Add a new protocol* between the explanatory paragraph and the list of protocols.

</p>

3.Click the button *Add a new protocol* to be redirected to the page containing the description of the protocol types and the red buttons *Sample Preparation Protocol*, *Measurement Protocol*, *Data Treatment Protocol*.

</p>

4.Press the red button named as the desired protocol type and arrive at its specific formular to complete. Regardless of the protocol type you choose to add, the first page of the protocol is approximately the same. It contains an explanation of the protocol parts and the questionnaire on *Part 1: General information*:

4.1.In the *Protocol name and description* area, complete the *Protocol original name*, *Version of this protocol*, *Variant of this protocol*, *Brief description*, *Long description*, *References* fields with free text and click the dropdown lists *Development phase*, *Confidentiality*, *License* to choose an exclusive item.

</p>

4.2.In the *Contacts* area, complete the *Name and email of contact person for the protocols* fields with free text.

4.3. In the *Technique and Endpoints* area, which is different for each protocol types:

4.3.1.For **Sample Preparation Protocol**, select in the *Technique* and *Endpoints* list boxes multiple options at a time by holding Ctrl.

4.3.2.For the **Measurement Protocol**, select in the *Technique* and *Phase* dropdown lists only one options and select in *Endpoints* list box multiple options at a time by holding Ctrl.

</p>

4.3.3.For the **Data Treatment Protocol**, this part doesn't exist.

5.Press the red bottom *Continue to next step* at the end of the first page, to arrive at the more specific part of each protocol type:

5.1.For the **Sample Preparation Protocol**, in the second page, *Part 2: Steps*, add one by one the steps of the protocol by choosing the number in the *Step* box, the action in the *Actions* dropdown list and the phases in the *Start Phase* and *End Phase* dropdown lists. Steps can be deleted by selecting the checkbox *Delete this step* and extended by pressing the *+Add another step* button.

</p>

5.2.For the **Measurement Protocol**:

5.2.1. In the second page, *Part 2: Equipment*, complete with free text in the:
- *Equipment* area, the *Name*, *Model*, *Instrument type*, *Limit of detection upper*, *Limit of detection lower*, *Limit of       detection unit*, *Instrument settings and parameters* fields;
- *Possible datasets* area, the *Axe*, *Units* fields;
- *Measurement quality parameters* area, *Parameter*, *Common setting* and *Units* fields.

In each of these areas, the fields can be deleted by checking the delete boxes or extended by clicking the addition button.

5.2.2.Click the red button *Continue to the next step* to arrive at the third page, *Part 3: Steps* where the steps can be added one by one.

5.2.3. Set the number in the *Step* number box, and complete with free text  the *Name* and *Description* fields. Optionally, upload an image via *Chose file* button in the *Image* box. Deleted undesired steps by selecting the checkbox *Delete this step* and extend the steps by pressing the *+Add another step* button.

5.3.For **Data Treatment Protocol**, in the second page, *Part 2: Steps*, addd steps one by one by setting the number in the *Step* number box, and complete with free text the *Algorithm applied*, *Resulting data* and *Parameters* fields. Delete undesired steps by selecting the checkbox *Delete this step* and extend the Steps by pressing the *+Add another step* button.

6.Click  the red *Submit protocol* button at the bottom of the last page of the protocol questionnaire (second page for **Sample Preparation Protocol** and **Data Treatment Protocol** and third page for the **Measurement Protocol**) to arrive at the page containing the *Preview protocol* allowing to proofread the protocol before submission.

7.If everything itâ€™s alright, commit the protocol by pressing the *Submit protocol* button. If corrections/modifications are needed, press the *Make more changes* button and edit any part, area or field of the protocol by passing through pages from *Part 1: General information* and moving towards the *Preview protocol* page.
