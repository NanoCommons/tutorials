## How do I access the knowledge infrastructure?
The ACEnano knowledge infrastructure is freely available (*under implementation*) to anyone interested in accessing or uploading data (including protocols and experimental results) related to physicochemical characterisation of nanomaterials.


## What are the main features of the knowledge infrastructure?
The ACEnano knowledge infrastructure (KI) is built using an open source software and includes multiple database instances (relational and non-rational (NoSQL) database) to optimally accommodate the requirements of the different data types (raw and processed data, summary results and protocols).
The features of the KI allows the users to:
* Create, store and share protocols on physicochemical characterisation of nanomaterials;
* Upload, store and share nanomaterials physicochemical characterisation data;
* Track the experimental results to the protocols used to generate the respective datasets.


## How do I add a new protocol?
The protocols database facilitates the access and sharing of methodologies applied in nanosafety. The methods are easy to browse and are linked to experimental datasets. This tool aims also to facilitate sharing of state of the art methods with the NanoEHS community and beyond.


## How do I create a new data workflow?
The data warehouse offers long-term storage of data produced by the nanosafety community. The data warehouse aims to support the data harmonisation and the implementation of FAIR principles towards the goal of generating a reference resource for nanomaterials risk assessment.
To achieve this goal, the user can select any of the data on samples and methods added into the protocols database, create and save the full workflow applied for the nanomaterials characterisation and link with the measurement results. This facilitates the tracking of results to the methodology, comparison of methods and results between different users or laboratories, support the round-robin experiments for method benchmarking and finally document all steps performed on a sample from the identification to the final results.


## How can I request support or suggest improvements of the platform?
