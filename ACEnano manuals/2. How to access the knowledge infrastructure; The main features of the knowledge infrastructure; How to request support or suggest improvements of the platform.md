## How to access the knowledge infrastructure
The ACEnano knowledge infrastructure is freely available to anyone interested in accessing or uploading data (including protocols and experimental results) related to physicochemical characterisation of nanomaterials.

* *Under implementation*

## The main features of the knowledge infrastructure
The ACEnano knowledge infrastructure (KI) is built using an open source software and includes multiple database instances (relational and non-rational (NoSQL) database) to optimally accommodate the requirements of the different data types (raw and processed data, summary results and protocols).
The features of the KI allows the users to:
* Create, store and share protocols on physicochemical characterisation of nanomaterials;
* Upload, store and share nanomaterials physicochemical characterisation data;
* Track the experimental results to the protocols used to generate the respective datasets.
