## How to create a new data workflow
The data warehouse offers long-term storage of data produced by the nanosafety community. The data warehouse aims to support the data harmonisation and the implementation of FAIR principles towards the goal of generating a reference resource for nanomaterials risk assessment.
To achieve this goal, the user can select any of the data on samples and methods added into the protocols database, create and save the full workflow applied for the nanomaterials characterisation and link with the measurement results. This facilitates the tracking of results to the methodology, comparison of methods and results between different users or laboratories, support the round-robin experiments for method benchmarking and finally document all steps performed on a sample from the identification to the final results.

After logging on at https://acenano.douglasconnect.com/ you can add a new dataset by following these steps:

1.Click the *Data* button from the top menu to open the *ACEnano Protocols* page.

4. On this page, choose the technique and the endpoint for which the analysis was done from the dropdown list *Technique* and from the list box *Endpoints* in which multiple selections can be done at a time by holding Ctrl.

5. Press the red bottom *Continue to next step* to continue with pages on chossing the *Sample Protocol*, *Measurement Protocol* and
*Data Treatment Protocol*
