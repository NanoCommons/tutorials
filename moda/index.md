To support the research into the computational modelling of materials the European Materials Modelling Council (EMMC) has developed a template to document
simulations, the MOdelling DAta (MODA) templates (see [https://emmc.eu/resources/moda/](https://emmc.eu/resources/moda/)). These documents are written in
a text editor like Microsoft Word and a repository of resulting PDFs has been set up on the aforementioned website, but there is also a MODA Portal
available at [https://moda-app.eu/](https://moda-app.eu/.).

MODA templates can be made more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). For example, they could be given a DOI by archiving them
simultaneously on Figshare or Zenodo and can be given copyright and license information. MODA templates can be further FAIR-ified by annotating their
content with ontology terms. One simple but effective approach is to include so-called compact identifiers [Wimalaratne et al., 2018].  

We provide here a simple approach to do such annotation, and where suitable ontology terms donâ€™t yet exist a means to add these terms into a workflow for
agreeing definitions and getting the terms added to the ENM ontology ([https://github.com/enanomapper/ontologies](https://github.com/enanomapper/ontologies)).
